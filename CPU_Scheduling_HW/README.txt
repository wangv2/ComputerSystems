Assignment: CPU Scheduling 

README.txt

This zip folder contains 3 files: SJF.cpp, RoundRobin.cpp, and SRTF.cpp. These files simulate three CPU scheduling algorithms in separate classes. 


To compile: 
COMPILING SJF.cpp:          g++ SJF.cpp
COMPILING RoundRobin.cpp:   g++ RoundRobin.cpp
COMPILING SRTF.cpp:         g++ SRTF.cpp

Each file should be compiled and run separately. 


To execute: 
EXECUTE SJF.cpp:            ./a.out jobs.txt
EXECUTE RoundRobin.cpp:     ./a.out jobs.txt
EXECUTE SRTF.cpp:           ./a.out jobs.txt

For executing the program, the user must type “./a.out” followed by the name of the file they wish to have read. In this example, the file name is “jobs.txt”. Therefore, the command line should be: “./a.out jobs.txt”.
