CPSC 5041 HOMEWORK 1:

This C++ program defines a Rectangle class. The class stores the length
and width and returns the area and perimeter of a Rectangle. The class
includes two constructors. The show() method prints a Rectangle's
dimensions. The sameArea(Rectangle) method compares two Rectangle
objects. This file includes a driver file, "hw1.cpp" that tests the
Rectangle class.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING PROGRAM:

Copy Rectangle.h, Rectangle.cpp and hw1.cpp into the CS1 server.
To compile, type "g++ Rectangle.cpp hw1.cpp".
To the run the executable file, type "./a.out"


INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXECUTING PROGRAM:

Once the program has compiled and begun to run, the user will be prompted
to enter input for five Rectanlge objects. When prompted to do so, enter
10 positive integers that will represent the length and width of each
Rectangle. Hit [RETURN] between each integer.

Start to input data once prompted to "Please enter lengths and widths for
five Rectangles".

Example input:
1
10
10
1
2u
10
4
5
5
4

Once 10 integers have been properly entered, data will be printed to the
screen. Information about each Rectangle object will be printed. Then,
information for the first instance of the Rectangle with the smallest area,
largest area, smallest perimeter, and largest perimeter will be printed to
the screen. Lastly, information about Rectangle objects with the same area
and perimeter will be printed. Next, the program will terminate.
